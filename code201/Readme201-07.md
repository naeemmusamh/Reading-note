2. th : its responsible to  call any element in the table and to call the text inside opening td you well cloning tag for it, but its purpose to represent the heading for either a column or a row.


3. colspan :The colspan attribute can be used on a th tag or td tag element and indicates how many columns that cell should run across.

4. rowspan : The rowspan attribute can be used on a th tag or td tag element to indicate how many rows a cell should span down the table.

There are three elements that help distinguish between the main content of the table and the first and last rows :

A- thead element tag : the heading of the table should si inside it.

# creating the variable in code

Each variable that you declare takes up memory. the more variables a browser has to remember,the more memory your script requires to run.

A variable actually references a value that is stored in memory. the same value can be used with more
than one variable.

# WHAT IS AN OBJECT

Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, variables and functions take on new names.

1. in an object : variable become known as properties

Properties tell us about the object 

2. in an object : function become known as methods

Methods represent tasks that are associated with the object.

Like variables and named functions, properties and methods have a name and a value.
In an object, that name is called a key. the object cannot have two keys with the same name. the value of a property can be (string, number, boolean, array, or anther object).

Programmers use a lot of name/value pairs:

• HTML uses attribute names and values.

• CSS uses property names and values.


In JavaScript:

• Variables have a name and you can assign them a value of a string, number, or Boolean.

• Arrays have a name and a group of values. item in an array is a name/value pair because it has an index number and a value.

• Named functions have a name and value that is a set of statements to run if the function is called.

• Objects consist of a set of name/value pairs.
