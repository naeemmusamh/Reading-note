# The Positioning Elements in CSS

There is two types of key concent for position element

1. block level

this one well start in a new line and include h1, p, ul and li.

the anther one used inline elements that flow in between surround text and include img, b and i.

2. containing elements

If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element.

A box may be nested inside several other block-level elements.

CSS allow you to control the layout of a page:

1. normal flow

Every block-level element appears on a new line, causing each item to appear lower down the page than the previous one. Even if you specify the width of the boxes and there is space for two elements to sit side-by side, they will not appear next to each other.

2. relative position

This moves an element from the position it would be in normal flow, shifting it to the top, right, bottom, or left of where it would have been placed.

3. absolute position

This positions the element in relation to its containing element. It is taken out of normal flow, meaning that it does not affect the position of any surrounding elements.

4. fixed position

This is a form of absolute positioning that positions the element in relation to the browser window, as opposed to the containing element.

5. float element

Floating an element allows you to take that element out of normal flow and position it to the far left or right of a containing box.
