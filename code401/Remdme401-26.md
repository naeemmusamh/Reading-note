# React Hook

## use Toggle

it takes a parameter with value true or false and toggles that value to opposite. It's useful when we want to take some action into it's opposite action, for example: show and hide modal, show more/show less text, open/close side menu.

## use Fire store Query

method you simply pass a query to it and you get back everything you need, including status, data, and error. Your component will re-render when data changes and your subscription will be automatically removed when the component unmounts.

## use Memo Compare

This hook is similar to useMemo, but instead of passing an array of dependencies we pass a custom compare function that receives the previous and new value. The compare function can then compare nested properties, call object methods, or anything else to determine equality.

## use Async

It's generally a good practice to indicate to users the status of any async request.

## use Require Auth

A common need is a way to redirect the user if they are signed out and trying to view a page that should require them to be authenticated.

## use Event Listener

is hook that handles checking if addEventListener is supported, adding the event listener, and removal on cleanup.

## use DarkMode

This hook handles all the stateful logic required to add a â˜¾ dark mode toggle to your website.
