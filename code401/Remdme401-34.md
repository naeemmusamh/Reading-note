# React Native

React Native is a JavaScript framework for writing real, natively rendering mobile applications for iOS and Android.It’s based on React, Facebook’s JavaScript library for building user interfaces, but instead of targeting the browser, it targets mobile platforms.You write your code in Javascript and it gets rendered natively.

## Expo

Expo is a framework for universal react applications.It’s a set of tools and services built around React Native to help develop, deploy and quickly iterate on iOs, Android and web apps from the same JS codebase.To start a new project, first globally install expo with npm install –global expo-cli.Then you can create a new project by expo init my-project.OR you can use expo snack to edit codes online (online IDE).

## Ejecting to ExpoKit

It’s a way to add custom native modules to a project.You can add modules that current expo doesn’t support.
