# Hash Tables

Hash - A hash is the result of some algorithm taking an incoming string and converting it into a value that could be used for either security or some other purpose. In the case of a hash table, it is used to determine the index of the array.

in side this array you stored you information with the key and value it will take space inside your array and give for it some reference to use it when you call it and return for you the information you store.

## what the table Hash ????

Hash tables are a data structure that utilize key value pairs. This means every Node or Bucket has both a key, and a value.

Example :
------------
  0  1   2  3
[⚪|⬜|🔹|💠]
[〰️]⏎      =>   hold banach (chang)


key : naeem
value : single

Hash (key) => index
⚪Hash (Naeem) => 0
⬜Hash (Ahmad) => 1
🔹Hash (Khald) => 2
💠Hash (Mohammad) => 3
〰️Hash (anything) => 1

## Why do we use them ???

1. Hold unique values

2. Dictionary

3. Library


The basic idea of a hash table is the ability to store the key into this data structure, and quickly retrieve the value. This is done through what we call a hash. A hash is the ability to encode the key that will eventually map to a specific location in the data structure that we can look at directly to retrieve the value.
