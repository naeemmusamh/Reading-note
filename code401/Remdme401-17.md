# AWS S3 and Lambda

## what is amazon S3 ???

it's service that allows you to store you data and element in the cloud and used anywhere you want.

advantage :

1. you can save in it any data with any size it will be.

2. save it from the hake and used from anyone.

3. you can used it anywhere you want and control and edit it.


## AWS Lambda???

AWS Lambda is one of the most popular serverless computing services out there. It is also the most popular provider used with the Serverless Framework.

it's A serverless computing service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers, or creating logic for scaling workload aware clusters

it provided by Amazon Web Services, The Lambda functions can perform any kind of computing task, from serving web pages and processing streams of data to calling APIs and integrating with other AWS services.

## Why is AWS Lambda an essential part of the Serverless architecture??

When building Serverless applications, AWS Lambda is one of the main candidates for running the application code. Typically, to complete a Serverless stack you’ll need:

1. a computing service.

2. a database service.

3. an HTTP gateway service.

## What are the most common use cases for AWS Lambda?


Due to Lambda’s architecture, it can deliver great benefits over traditional cloud computing setups for applications where:

1. individual tasks run for a short time.

2. each task is generally self-contained.

3. there is a large difference between the lowest and highest levels in the workload of the application.

## what is the most common use cases for AWS Lambda??

1. Scalable APIs :
 
When building APIs using AWS Lambda, one execution of a Lambda function can serve a single HTTP request.

2. Data processing :
 
Lambda functions are optimized for event-based data processing. It is easy to integrate AWS Lambda with data sources like Amazon DynamoDB.

3. Task automation :

With its event-driven model and flexibility, AWS Lambda is a great fit for automating various business tasks that don’t require an entire server at all times.

## Supported languages and run times ???

1. Node.js 8.10

2. Node.js 10.x

3. Node.js 12.x

4. Python 2.7

5. Python 3.6

6. Python 3.7

7. Python 3.8

8. Ruby 2.5

9. Java 8

All these run times are maintained by AWS and are provided in an Amazon Linux or Amazon Linux 2 environment. For each of the supported languages, AWS provides an SDK that makes it easier for you to write your Lambda functions and integrate them with other AWS services.

## Benefits of using AWS Lambda???

1. pay per use.

2. fully managed infrastructure.

3. Automatic scaling.

4. Tight integration with other AWS products.

# SMB

## What does this mean for an SMB?

CDNs are something that larger companies are more likely to implement.

## why company want to use CDNs??

1. improve Internet website load speeds.

2. content delivery speeds.

3. to reduce the likelihood of falling victim to and improve defenses against Distributed Denial of Service attacks.



A smaller company probably doesn’t need to improve website load speeds with a CDN as they typically don’t have an overwhelming amount of traffic. A Distributed Denial of Service attack may pose a potential threat against gambling companies or other mid-to-large enterprises such as banks or defense contractors.
