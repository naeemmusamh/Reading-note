# Context

Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

## When to Use Context

Context is designed to share data that can be considered “global” for a tree of React components, such as the current authenticated user, theme.

If you only want to avoid passing some props through many levels, component composition is often a simpler solution than context.

## API

Creates a Context object. When React renders a component that subscribes to this Context object it will read the current context value from the closest matching Provider above it in the tree.

The defaultValue argument is only used when a component does not have a matching Provider above it in the tree.
