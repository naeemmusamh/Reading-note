# How to think like a programmer ‚Äî lessons in problem solving

We all have problems. Big and small. How we deal with them is sometimes, well‚Ä¶pretty random.

1. Try a solution.

2. If that doesn‚Äôt work, try another one.

3. If that doesn‚Äôt work, repeat step 2 until you luck out.

Look, sometimes you luck out. But that is the worst way to solve problems! And it‚Äôs a huge, huge waste of time.

A. Have a framework 

To find the right framework, I followed the advice in The 4-Hour Chef is a five-stop journey through the art and science of learning:

1. META-LEARNING.

2. THE DOMESTIC.

3. THE WILD.

4. THE SCIENTIST.

5. THE PROFESSIONAL.

## So, what should you do when you encounter a new problem?

Here are the steps:

1. Understand

you should write down your problem, doodle a diagram, or tell someone else about it.

2. Plan

don‚Äôt start hacking straight away. Give your brain time to analyze the problem and process the information.

3. Divide

Pay attention. This is the most important step of all. Do not try to solve one big problem. You will cry.

solve each sub-problem one by one. Begin with the simplest. After that, simplest means this sub-problem being solved doesn‚Äôt depend on others being solved.

4. Stuck

First off, take a deep breath. Second, that‚Äôs fair. in fact, here are three things to try when facing a whammy:

A- Debug

B- Reassess

C- Side note

Don‚Äôt expect to be great after just one week. If you want to be a good problem-solver, solve a lot of problems! üòú

# Pretend Your Time is Worth

Still, many people waste much of their time on pointless, low-quality activities that don‚Äôt help them reach their true goals.

The truth is, most people value their time at far, far less than it‚Äôs worth.

They say yes to things they have no business doing. They give away their talents, attention, and effort to others who take, take, take.

They spend hours watching low-quality television and social media when they should be productive and effective.

See, many people could be making a fortune but instead, they give away their time in unproductive ways that leave them broke, unhappy, and stuck.

When you‚Äôre busy, you are on autopilot. You can‚Äôt see the hours slipping away, time you‚Äôll never get back.

If you let people know your time is free and low-valued, people will treat it as such.
But if you teach people that your time is expensive, important, and valuable, then people will respond in kind.

What you think is what you become. If you think your time is worth a few bucks an hour, that you‚Äôll begin to act like it. You‚Äôll find yourself saying ‚Äúyes‚Äù to meaningless, pointless obligations.

But if, in your heart, you know your time is valuable‚Ä¶ People will recognize that. People will respect that. People will treat you differently.

# Getting to the Root of a Problem Quickly

You can use Whys for troubleshooting, quality improvement, and problem solving, but it is most effective when used to resolve simple or moderately difficult problems.

The model follows a very simple seven-step process:

1. Assemble a Team

Gather together people who are familiar with the specifics of the problem, and with the process that you're trying to fix. Include someone to act as a facilitator , who can keep the team focused on identifying effective counter-measures.

2. Define the Problem

If you can, observe the problem in action. Discuss it with your team and write a brief, clear problem statement that you all agree on.

3. Ask the First "Why?"

Asking "Why?" sounds simple, but answering it requires serious thought. Search for answers that are grounded in fact: they must be accounts of things that have actually happened, not guesses at what might have happened.

4. Ask "Why?" Four More Times

For each of the answers that you generated in Step 3, ask four further "whys" in succession. Each time, frame the question in response to the answer you've just recorded.

5. Know When to Stop

You'll know that you've revealed the root cause of the problem when asking "why" produces no more useful responses, and you can go no further. An appropriate counter-measure or process change should then become evident.

6. Address the Root Cause

Now that you've identified at least one root cause, you need to discuss and agree on the counter-measures that will prevent the problem from recurring.

7. Monitor Your Measures

Keep a close watch on how effectively your counter-measures eliminate or minimize the initial problem. You may need to amend them, or replace them entirely. If this happens, it's a good idea to repeat the 5 Whys process to ensure that you've identified the correct root cause.
