# Redux - Additional Topics

## Redux Toolkit

The makers of Redux have recognized that Redux is complicated and have introduced a “Batteries Included, Highly Opinionated” framework for making stores called the Redux Toolkit.

### Simple

Includes utilities to simplify common use cases like store setup, creating reducers, immutable update logic, and more.

### Opinionated

Provides good defaults for store setup out of the box, and includes the most commonly used Redux addons built-in.

### Powerful

Takes inspiration from libraries like Immer and Autodux to let you write "mutative" immutable update logic, and even create entire "slices" of state automatically.

### Effective

Lets you focus on the core logic your app needs, so you can do more work with less code.

## Hookstate

Is a modern alternative to Redux, Mobx, Formik without boilerplate, it is simple but incredibly fast and flexible state management that is based on React state hook.

## MobX

is a battle tested library that makes state management simple and scalable by transparently applying functional reactive programming (TFRP). The philosophy behind MobX is very simple: Anything that can be derived from the application state, should be derived.
